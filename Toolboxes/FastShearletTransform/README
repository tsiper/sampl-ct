FFST - Fast Finite Shearlet Transform

Overview
--------
The FFST package provides a fast implementation of the Finite Shearlet Transform. 
Following the the path via the continuous shearlet transform,
its counterpart on cones and finally its discretization on the full grid we obtain the
translation invariant discrete shearlet transform. Our discrete shearlet transform 
can be efficiently computed by the fast Fourier transform (FFT).
The discrete shearlets constitute a Parseval frame of the finite Euclidean space such that

The Matlab-Version of the toolbox is available for free download at

               http://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/imagepro/software/

The zip-file contains all relevant files and folders. Simply unzip the archive 
and add the folder (with subfolders!) to your Matlab-path or run installFFST.m.

The folder FFST contains the main files for the both directions of the transform. 
The included shearlets are stored in the folder shearlets. The folder helper 
contains some helper functions. To create  simple geometric structures some 
functions are provided in create. See contents.m and the comments in each 
file for more information.

Installation
------------
Run installFFST.m to add all folders to your MATLAB path.
To check if everything is installed correctly run simple_example.m for testing.
